# BERT-Q-A-System

In this project I have used a BERT model called bert-base-cased-squad2 from the Hugging Face library.This project can generate answers according to the context and questions given to the model.

The Google Colab Notebook is uploaded in the Notebook directory.The libraries used here is basically Transformers library from which the BERT tokenizer and pipelines etc. are imported.

The context and questions in the notebook were generated by ChatGPT (GPT 3.5 Model).The question-answering pipeline is then used into which the context and questions are passed.The model then outputs the answers .The score is also given in the results.
